        intelligently like the human mind.
       <br> AI
        can process large amounts of data in ways, unlike
        humans. <br>The goal for AI is to be able to do things such

        Elon Musk
        , the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX,
        recently stated that AI has the potential to
        become the
        "most disruptive force in
        history."<br>
        Musk highlighted a future scenario where
        AI surpasses human intelligence, reaching
        a point where jobs become unnecessary,
        allowing individuals to select employment
        based on personal fulfillment.<br>
        Sam Altman,
        co-founder of ChatGPT,
        warned :
        "Entire classes of jobs will go
        away and not come back.‚Äù<br>

     <p style="color: blue; font-size: 20px;">Generative AI, a rising star, can create human-like text, graphics, summarise scientific articles, debug code, execute commands like crafting Microsoft Excel formulas and much more!<br> The entry of OpenAI's
        ChatGPT
        and Google's
        Bard
        hasignited fierce competition, ushering in a new era of innovation in the field of AI.<br>
        A Goldman Sachs report suggests that generative AI could automate 18% of global work, impacting approximately
        300
        million jobs, with advanced economies facing a higher impact.<br> In the U.S. and Europe, two-thirds of jobs areexpected to be exposed to some degree of AI automation, and around
        25%
        of all jobs might be entirely performed by AI. <br>Globally, the study reveals the potential automation of the workforce, with certain countries, including the U.S., U.K., Japan, and Hong Kong, facing rates exceeding
        28%.<br></p>

         <p style="color: blue; font-size: 20px;"><b>Public Concerns:</b><br>
            A Forbes survey
            reveals that 77% of
            Americans express
            worry about AI causing job losses,
            reflecting widespread concerns among
            the population.<br>
           <b> WEF Jobs Outlook:</b><br>
            Contrary to fears of
            mass unemployment, the World
            Economic Forum's 2020 Jobs Report
            predicts a net gain, anticipating the
            creation of 97 million jobs alongside the
            displacement of 85 million due to AI.<br>
           <b>LLM Challenges:</b><br>
            ChatGPT brings misinformation challenges,
            requiring regular fact-checking and human oversight.<br>
            <b>Judgment and AI:</b><br>
            LLMs, due to their inherent limitations,
            demonstrate a lack of independent judgment.<br> This underscores the critical necessity for human supervision
            when utilizing such models to ensure responsible and
            contextually appropriate outcomes.<br>
          <b> Strategic Upskilling:</b><br>
            Continual upskilling ensures job
            security by overcoming AI limitations. AI's productivity
            focus empowers professionals to concentrate on high-value
            tasks in roles like graphic design and software development.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 29px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color: purple;"><b>My Opinion</b></p>
            <p style="color: rgb(29, 132, 29); font-size: 24px;">"I don't believe it can ever replace humans but instead we have the ultimate power.<br>
            It can certainly handle all the inferior tasks so that we can become more productive.<br>
        Still it will always require human supervision and feedback."<br></p>
